# TODO

Deferred, non-blocking follow-ups. Each item notes what, why it was deferred, and where to fix it.

## Services / Booking

### Re-snapshot compensation on admin reassign
- **What:** When an admin reassigns an appointment to a different fulfiller via the lifecycle
  `assign` action, the appointment's `rule_snapshot` (frozen compensation) is **not** recomputed, so
  payout reporting could use the *previous* fulfiller's comp.
- **Current behavior (correct for the common path):** the **customer booking** flow snapshots comp at
  reserve time — `reserve_route` in `src/handlers/booking.py` calls
  `compensation_snapshot(service, fulfiller)` (`src/stripe_link/domain/booking.py`) and stores it on
  `appointment.rule_snapshot`. Only the *manual admin reassign* path is missing the re-snapshot.
- **Where to fix:** the `assign` action in `appointment_action_route`
  (`src/handlers/services.py`). It currently only sets `assigned_fulfiller_id` via
  `transition_appointment(..., "assign", ...)`. To re-freeze comp it must load the service and the new
  fulfiller and recompute `rule_snapshot = compensation_snapshot(service, fulfiller)` — which means
  giving that handler access to the services + fulfillers repos (it currently only has the appointments
  repo). Keep the domain `transition_appointment` pure; compute the snapshot in the handler and merge
  it into the saved document.
- **Why deferred:** manual reassignment is an edge case; the primary booking path is correct. Introduced
  in Phase B.5.

## Dashboard / UX

### Build the beginner-friendly custom-domain wizard
- **What:** Replace the current bare custom-domain form with the guided, auto-polling wizard designed
  in **`docs/CUSTOM_DOMAIN_WIZARD.md`** (single flow for beginners + power users; reveals DNS records
  progressively; explains propagation; auto-checks status so users rarely click "Check Status").
- **Current behavior:** the backend is in place (`src/handlers/custom_domains.py` +
  `custom_domains_resolve.py`, Cloudflare Worker + resolve API); the dashboard only exposes the simple
  TenantConfig-based form inside `dashboard-vue/src/components/Configuration.vue`.
- **Where to fix:** build the wizard as a dashboard component (its own multi-step flow) per the
  reference design; wire it to the existing custom-domains endpoints. No backend changes needed.
- **Why deferred:** the functional path works via the Configuration form; the wizard is a UX upgrade.

## Production setup

### Create a separate prod Google OAuth client (calendar)
- **What:** Before enabling calendar sync in **prod**, create a *separate* Google OAuth 2.0 client
  for production (option #2 — isolated credentials per environment), in the same Google Cloud project
  / consent screen as dev.
- **Steps:** (1) Google Cloud → Credentials → create a new OAuth client (Web application);
  (2) add the prod redirect URI `https://prod.juniorbay.com/calendar/callback` to it;
  (3) store its creds with `./deploy/google-oauth-secrets.sh prod` (client_id + client_secret only —
  the refresh token is optional/test-only); (4) submit the app for **Google verification** (sensitive
  scopes) before serving real tenants — has lead time, start early.
- **Already handled:** the secret is per-env (`jb/google-oauth/prod`), the deploy auto-derives
  `CalendarRedirectUri` from the prod API domain, and the CalendarFunction reads the prod secret.
- **Why deferred:** dev calendar work is validated on the dev client; prod client is only needed when
  calendar sync goes live in prod.

## Landing Pages / SEO

### Implement an on-page SEO checklist for landing pages
- **What:** Emit proper on-page SEO for rendered landing pages: unique `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`,
  canonical URL, **Open Graph** + **Twitter Card** tags, and **JSON-LD structured data** (e.g.,
  `Product`/`Offer` with price/availability, `BreadcrumbList`; `Service` for booking pages), plus
  sensible robots/`hreflang` defaults, semantic headings, and descriptive image `alt` text.
- **Where to fix:** the storefront renderer (`src/stripe_link/runtime/html.py`) is where page `<head>`
  and body markup are produced; the SEO fields should live on the **Page document** (title,
  description, social image, structured-data hints) so tenants — and the AI generator — can set them.
- **Ties into:** the composition/preset system (PRD Phase 1) — SEO metadata is part of the page
  vocabulary the AI emits; and product/offer data already on the page (for `Product`/`Offer` JSON-LD).
- **Why deferred:** functional pages render today; SEO is an enhancement layer. Best done alongside the
  Phase 1 composition refactor so the metadata surface is designed once.
