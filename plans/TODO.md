# TODO

Deferred, non-blocking follow-ups. Each item notes what, why it was deferred, and where to fix it.

## Services / Booking

### Decouple Booking from Service (Booking = its own primitive)
- **What:** `Appointment` is 1:1 with a service today. Make a **Booking** its own primitive — a scheduled
  visit covering **one or more** service line items — and let a Service declare `fulfillment_mode`
  (`scheduled` | `no_booking`). The **Offer** coordinates delivery (`service_booking_mode`:
  `single_visit` | `separate_visits`). Full design in **`plans/BOOKING_AS_PRIMITIVE.md`**.
- **Deferred sub-phases that must not fall through:**
  - **Multi-fulfiller single visit (multi-resource scheduling)** — different delegates performing
    different services in the *same* visit (find a slot where all required fulfillers are free). v1
    restricts a combined booking to **one fulfiller / unassigned**; this is its own non-trivial phase.
  - **Per-item `booking_group` on offers** — mixed offers where some services share a visit and others
    are separate (beyond the offer-wide `single_visit`/`separate_visits` switch).
  - **Service tax categories** — `no_booking` services stay *services* for fiscal/tax reasons (differ
    from products); per-service tax classification pairs with the commerce tax/fee work.
- **Why deferred:** design locked 2026-07-08, no code yet; awaiting greenlight to start Phase 1
  (Booking.services[] + read adapter + Service.fulfillment_mode, no behavior change).

### Consider adding a wizard for the services page
- Idea only — not planned yet. The Create Service flow is dense; a guided wizard (Basics → Pricing
  → "fulfill yourself or delegate?" → conditional staff/calendar/check-in steps) could simplify it
  for tenants. Monitoring whether it's worth building; revisit later.

### Re-snapshot compensation on admin reassign
- **What:** When an admin reassigns an appointment to a different fulfiller via the lifecycle
  `assign` action, the appointment's `rule_snapshot` (frozen compensation) is **not** recomputed, so
  payout reporting could use the *previous* fulfiller's comp.
- **Current behavior (correct for the common path):** the **customer booking** flow snapshots comp at
  reserve time — `reserve_route` in `src/handlers/booking.py` calls
  `compensation_snapshot(service, fulfiller)` (`src/stripe_link/domain/booking.py`) and stores it on
  `appointment.rule_snapshot`. Only the *manual admin reassign* path is missing the re-snapshot.
- **Where to fix:** the `assign` action in `appointment_action_route`
  (`src/handlers/services.py`). It currently only sets `assigned_fulfiller_id` via
  `transition_appointment(..., "assign", ...)`. To re-freeze comp it must load the service and the new
  fulfiller and recompute `rule_snapshot = compensation_snapshot(service, fulfiller)` — which means
  giving that handler access to the services + fulfillers repos (it currently only has the appointments
  repo). Keep the domain `transition_appointment` pure; compute the snapshot in the handler and merge
  it into the saved document.
- **Why deferred:** manual reassignment is an edge case; the primary booking path is correct. Introduced
  in Phase B.5.

## Dashboard / UX

### Build the beginner-friendly custom-domain wizard
- **What:** Replace the current bare custom-domain form with the guided, auto-polling wizard designed
  in **`docs/CUSTOM_DOMAIN_WIZARD.md`** (single flow for beginners + power users; reveals DNS records
  progressively; explains propagation; auto-checks status so users rarely click "Check Status").
- **Current behavior:** the backend is in place (`src/handlers/custom_domains.py` +
  `custom_domains_resolve.py`, Cloudflare Worker + resolve API); the dashboard only exposes the simple
  TenantConfig-based form inside `dashboard-vue/src/components/Configuration.vue`.
- **Where to fix:** build the wizard as a dashboard component (its own multi-step flow) per the
  reference design; wire it to the existing custom-domains endpoints. No backend changes needed.
- **Why deferred:** the functional path works via the Configuration form; the wizard is a UX upgrade.
  Reference design written 2026-07-03, not yet built.

## Production setup

### Create a separate prod Google OAuth client (calendar)
- **What:** Before enabling calendar sync in **prod**, create a *separate* Google OAuth 2.0 client
  for production (option #2 — isolated credentials per environment), in the same Google Cloud project
  / consent screen as dev.
- **Steps:** (1) Google Cloud → Credentials → create a new OAuth client (Web application);
  (2) add the prod redirect URI `https://prod.juniorbay.com/calendar/callback` to it;
  (3) store its creds with `./deploy/google-oauth-secrets.sh prod` (client_id + client_secret only —
  the refresh token is optional/test-only); (4) submit the app for **Google verification** (sensitive
  scopes) before serving real tenants — has lead time, start early.
- **Already handled:** the secret is per-env (`jb/google-oauth/prod`), the deploy auto-derives
  `CalendarRedirectUri` from the prod API domain, and the CalendarFunction reads the prod secret.
- **Why deferred:** dev calendar work is validated on the dev client; prod client is only needed when
  calendar sync goes live in prod.

### Apply for 10DLC (AWS End User Messaging SMS) — required before real SMS sending
Gates Phase C.2 (appointment reminders) and the SMS-delivery option for payable invoices. Submit-and-
wait review, **several business days to ~2–3 weeks**; start early. Code can be built/tested against a
fake in the meantime.
- **Prep:** legal business name + **EIN**, business address, website; a **website privacy policy that
  mentions SMS**; the **opt-in story** (customer enters phone at booking and is told they'll get
  reminders + "reply STOP to opt out" — the booking flow needs this consent line when C.2 is built);
  2–3 **sample messages** (e.g. "Reminder: your [Business] appointment is tomorrow at 2:00 PM. Reply
  STOP to opt out.").
- **Steps:** (1) AWS Console → **AWS End User Messaging SMS**; (2) Phone numbers → Registrations →
  **10DLC company (brand)** — legal name/EIN/address/website/vertical → submit (usually fast);
  (3) **10DLC campaign** tied to the brand, use case **Customer Care / Low Volume Mixed** (reminders
  are transactional), with sample messages + opt-in + HELP/STOP text → submit (the slow vetting step);
  (4) once approved, **request a 10DLC phone number** and associate it with the campaign;
  (5) create a **configuration set** for delivery receipts.
- **Costs (approx, pass-through):** one-time brand (~a few $) + campaign vetting (~$15) + **~$10–15/mo**
  per campaign + small per-message carrier fees.
- **Platform model:** register **one** platform brand + campaign; the platform number sends reminders
  that *reference* each tenant's business (simplest compliant model for multi-tenant SaaS).
- **C.2 code status (built 2026-07-07, dev):** the reminder engine ships and runs against a fake — pure
  `src/stripe_link/domain/reminders.py` (plan/due/cancel/format), the `src/stripe_link/sms.py` adapter
  (`pinpoint-sms-voice-v2`), and the `RemindersFunction` sweep (`handlers/reminders.py`, EventBridge
  `rate(15 minutes)`). Reminders are planned on confirm/paid/reschedule and canceled on cancel.
  **To go live once the number is approved:** run `./deploy/sms-origination-secrets.sh prod` and enter
  the approved 10DLC number (or phone-pool ARN) + optional configuration set. It is stored in Secrets
  Manager (`jb/sms-origination/{env}`) and read at **runtime** by the sweep — so it takes effect on the
  next sweep (~15 min) with **no redeploy**, and can be rotated the same way. Until it is set the sweep
  no-ops (`skipped: sms_not_configured`). The **opt-in consent line** is already on the public booking
  form; STOP/HELP + the opt-out list are handled by End User Messaging itself, and `sms_opted_out` on
  the customer is honored as a belt-and-suspenders. Use a test/simulator number in dev the same way.
- **Future precision upgrade (optional):** swap the 15-min sweep for a per-booking **EventBridge
  Scheduler** one-shot (exact-minute delivery). The `domain/reminders.py` planning is model-agnostic, so
  only the handler/infra changes; a two-way inbound-STOP SNS handler could also record app-level opt-out.

### Verify the Google OAuth app (Calendar sensitive scopes) — before prod calendar at scale
Removes the "unverified app" warning, the ~100-user cap, and the 7-day refresh-token expiry. Review
takes **days to a couple of weeks**. Calendar scopes are *sensitive* (not *restricted*), so **no**
third-party security assessment is required.
- **Prep:** a public **homepage** on the domain (`https://juniorbay.com`); a **privacy policy URL** on
  that domain disclosing Google user-data usage + **Limited Use** compliance (can be generated from the
  legal-pages system — needs the Google-specific language added); **verify domain ownership** in Google
  Search Console; an **unlisted YouTube demo video** showing the consent flow + each scope in use (the
  C.1b connect flow on dev can be screen-recorded for this).
- **Steps:** (1) Google Cloud → **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**; (2) complete app name, logo,
  support email, home page, privacy policy + terms URLs, **Authorized domains** (`juniorbay.com`);
  (3) confirm scopes `calendar.events` + `calendar.readonly`; (4) **Publish App** (Testing → In
  production); (5) **Prepare for verification** — submit scope justifications + demo video + policy URLs;
  (6) wait for approval.

## Landing Pages / SEO

### BUG: client-marquee (Client logos) renders on the published page but NOT in the builder preview
- **Symptom:** Add a Client logos section with logos. The **published page renders it** (heading + logo
  chips), but the **Live Preview never shows it** — nothing where it should sit (between trust badges and
  the price card).
- **Ruled out via an in-preview debug line:** it's NOT data/filter — the debug showed
  `previewElements = 1 [client_marquee]`, `rawEls = 1`, `marqueeLogos = 2`, so the section reaches
  `previewElements` with its logos. NOT `elementSection` / `sectionVisible` / `builderSections` /
  `elementsFromPage` (all verified; published uses the same path and works). NOT `v-html`/`headlineHtml`
  nor the inline arrow-`filter` in the `v-for` (both replaced with a plain heading + `marqueeLogos()`
  method — still missing). Container `.landing-live-preview` is `display:grid`; `.preview-marquee` is a
  grid child.
- **Points at:** the `v-else-if="entry.element.type === 'client_marquee'"` branch in
  `<template v-for="entry in previewElements">` (dashboard-vue/src/components/LandingPages.vue, ~L724)
  not matching/rendering despite the entry being present and its type matching.
- **Fastest next steps:** (1) inspect the live DOM — is `.preview-marquee` present-but-0-height or absent?
  (2) temporarily make that branch a standalone `v-if` (not `v-else-if`) to test whether the long
  `v-if/v-else-if` chain silently breaks at that node; (3) check the compiled render / Vue devtools.
- **Everything else about client_marquee works:** color logos on chips, default "Our Clients" heading,
  centered, roll-only-if-≥5, published render, upload button, alt-text label.

### Implement an on-page SEO checklist for landing pages
- **What:** Emit proper on-page SEO for rendered landing pages: unique `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`,
  canonical URL, **Open Graph** + **Twitter Card** tags, and **JSON-LD structured data** (e.g.,
  `Product`/`Offer` with price/availability, `BreadcrumbList`; `Service` for booking pages), plus
  sensible robots/`hreflang` defaults, semantic headings, and descriptive image `alt` text.
- **Where to fix:** the storefront renderer (`src/stripe_link/runtime/html.py`) is where page `<head>`
  and body markup are produced; the SEO fields should live on the **Page document** (title,
  description, social image, structured-data hints) so tenants — and the AI generator — can set them.
- **Ties into:** the composition/preset system (PRD Phase 1) — SEO metadata is part of the page
  vocabulary the AI emits; and product/offer data already on the page (for `Product`/`Offer` JSON-LD).
- **Why deferred:** functional pages render today; SEO is an enhancement layer. Best done alongside the
  Phase 1 composition refactor so the metadata surface is designed once.
